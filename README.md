# Capacitor-Modeling
A repository for all things Capacitor Modeling, including:
 - Dielectric modeling: dielectric response and breakdown
 - Electric field sim: simulations of the electric field and charge distribution for different capacitor geometries
 - Thermal analysis
 - Other

Feel free to edit as needed.
Several files are taken from nandandiwan's nanotech-capacitor repo who previously worked on the electric field sim
